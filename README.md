# Travaelling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-optimized-version
Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Self-Organizing Maps This repository contains an implementation of a Self Organizing Map that can be used to find sub-optimal solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem. The instances of the problems that the program supports are .tsp files, which is a widespread format in this problem. All the source code can be found in the src directory, while a report and brief presentation slides (in Spanish) can be found in the report folder. However, for a complete read on the topic, you can read my blog post explaining this implementation and its evaluation.
